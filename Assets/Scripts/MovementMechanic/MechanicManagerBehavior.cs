// The mechanic works like this: A particle orbits a sphere and passes through a visor. If the player hits the space bar while the particle is inside the
// visor, the sphere's radius doubles and the particle's speed increases. If the user manages to hit the space bar again while the particle is inside the
// visor, the sphere's radius is doubled one again. If the player manages to hit the space bar at the right time again, the sphere's radius goes back to
// initial value. The speed of the particle stays the same. So there are 3 levels before the whole setup shrinks back to its initial size. Once it's at
// its initial size, the whole spiel starts over again: It increases in size twice before shrinking down to its initial size again. For the sake of making the
// documentation a tad clearer, the different sizes of the sphere and positions of the visor and particle are referred to as levels. Level 1 being the initial
// position and size of the sphere, particle and visor, level 2 being the position and size when the user times the space bar correctly once, level 3 when
// the user times it again a second time. After level 3, it goes back to level 1 but the speed of the particle does not change.
